"Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers","{""Timothy Ferriss""}","<DIV><B>The latest groundbreaking tome from Tim Ferriss, the #1 </B><I><B>New York Times </B></I><B>best-selling author of </B><I><B>The 4-Hour Workweek</B></I><B>.</B><BR />  <BR /><B>From the author:</B><BR />  <BR /> “For the last two years, I’ve interviewed nearly two hundred world-class performers for my podcast, <I>The Tim Ferriss Show. </I>The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview, and the show is on the cusp of passing 100 million downloads.<BR />  <BR /> “This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‘inside baseball’ you won’t find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.<BR />  <BR /> “What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?<BR />  <BR /> “I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.<BR />  <BR /> “Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I’ve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.<BR />  <BR /> “I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It’s changed my life, and I hope the same for you.”</DIV>"
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,"{""Yuval Noah Harari""}","<p><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>A Summer Reading Pick for President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg </strong></p><p>From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”</p><p>One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?</p><p>Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, <em>Sapiens</em> integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.</p><p>Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?</p><p>Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month for February 2015:</strong> Yuval Noah Harari has some questions. Among the biggest: <em>How did</em> Homo sapiens <em>(or</em> Homo sapiens sapiens <em>, if you’re feeling especially wise today) evolve from an unexceptional savannah-dwelling primate to become the dominant force on the planet, emerging as the lone survivor out of six distinct, competing hominid species?</em> He also has some answers, and they’re not what you’d expect. Tackling evolutionary concepts from a historian’s perspective, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>, describes human development through a framework of three not-necessarily-orthodox “Revolutions”: the Cognitive, the Agricultural, and the Scientific. His ideas are interesting and often amusing: <em>Why have humans managed to build astonishingly large populations when other primate groups top out at 150 individuals?</em> Because our talent for gossip allows us to build networks in societies too large for personal relationships between everyone, and our universally accepted “imagined realities”--such as money, religion, and Limited Liability Corporations—keep us in line.  <em>Who cultivated whom, humans or wheat?</em>. Wheat. Though the concepts are unusual and sometimes heavy (as is the book, literally) Harari’s deft prose and wry, subversive humor make quick work of material prone to academic tedium. He’s written a book of popular nonfiction (it was a bestseller overseas, no doubt in part because his conclusions draw controversy) landing somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of genetics, sociology, and history. Throughout, Harari returns frequently to another question: <em>Does all this progress make us happier, our lives easier?</em> The answer might disappoint you. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p>"
The Alchemist,"{""Paulo Coelho""}","<p>A special 25th anniversary edition of the extraordinary international bestseller, including a new Foreword by Paulo Coelho.</p><p>Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, <em>The Alchemist</em> has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.</p><p>Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.</p>Like the one-time bestseller <I>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</I>, <i>The Alchemist</i> presents a simple fable, based on simple truths and places it in a highly unique situation. And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he's off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream. <p>  Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman's books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists--men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the ""Soul of the World."" Of course he does eventually meet an alchemist, and the ensuing student-teacher relationship clarifies much of the boy's misguided agenda, while also emboldening him to stay true to his dreams. ""My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,"" the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night. <p>  ""Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself,"" the alchemist replies. ""And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity."" <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"
Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike,"{""Phil Knight""}","In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and board chairman Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.<BR><BR>Young, searching, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year, 1963. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knight’s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is more than a logo. A symbol of grace and greatness, it’s one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world.<BR> <BR>But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. Now, in a memoir that’s surprising, humble, unfiltered, funny, and beautifully crafted, he tells his story at last. It all begins with a classic crossroads moment. Twenty-four years old, backpacking through Asia and Europe and Africa, wrestling with life’s Great Questions, Knight decides the unconventional path is the only one for him. Rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, something new, dynamic, different. Knight details the many terrifying risks he encountered along the way, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors, the countless doubters and haters and hostile bankers—as well as his many thrilling triumphs and narrow escapes. Above all, he recalls the foundational relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers.<BR> <BR>Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the redemptive, transformative power of sports, they created a brand, and a culture, that changed everything."
Steve Jobs,"{""Walter Isaacson""}","<strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: It is difficult to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em> without feeling melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs’s focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. <em>--Chris Schluep</em><br/>  <br/> <br/>  <p><span class=""h1""><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Walter Isaacson </strong></span><br /><span class=""h1""><strong> </strong></span><img height=""300"" src="" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/SIMON/IsaacsonWalter._V164348457_.jpg"" style=""float: right;"" width=""450"" /></p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> It's becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.</p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.</p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be.</p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs' contradictions contribute to his success?</p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology. </p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. </p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe he was a genius? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.</p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he have regrets? </p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.</p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is his legacy?</p>  <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his ""Think Different"" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p>  <p> <b>Photo credit:</b> Patrice Gilbert Photography</p>"

Siddhartha,"{""Hermann Hesse""}","In the novel, <i>Siddhartha</i>, a young man, leaves his family for a contemplative life, then, restless, discards it for one of the flesh. He conceives a son, but bored and sickened by lust and greed, moves on again. Near despair, Siddhartha comes to a river where he hears a unique sound. This sound signals the true beginning of his life -- the beginning of suffering, rejection, peace, and, finally, wisdom.In the shade of a banyan tree, a grizzled ferryman sits listening to the  river. Some say he's a sage. He was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like  thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons.  But this man, Siddhartha, was not a follower of any but his own soul. Born the  son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence, and  charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future  for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a  life of pleasure and titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he  was just like all the other ""child people,"" dragged around by his desires. Like  Hermann Hesse's other creations of struggling young men, <I>Siddhartha</I> has a  good dose of European angst and stubborn individualism. His final epiphany  challenges both the Buddhist and the Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a  practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to  blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the  reader's ear down to hear answers from the river. In this translation Sherab  Chodzin Kohn captures the slow, spare lyricism of Siddhartha's search, putting  her version on par with Hilda Rosner's standard edition. <I>--Brian Bruya</I>"
Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion,"{""Gary Vaynerchuk""}","<p>Do you have a hobby you wish you could indulge in all day? An obsession that keeps you up at night? Now is the perfect time to take that passion and make a living doing what you love. In <em>Crush It!</em> Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion, Gary Vaynerchuk shows you how to use the power of the Internet to turn your real interests into real businesses. Gary spent years building his family business from a local wine shop into a national industry leader. Then one day he turned on a video camera, and by using the secrets revealed here, transformed his entire life and earning potential by building his personal brand. By the end of this book, readers will have learned how to harness the power of the Internet to make their entrepreneurial dreams come true. Step by step, <em>Crush It!</em> is the ultimate driver’s manual for modern business.</p><p align=""left""><span class=""h1""><strong>The Story Behind <em>Crush it!</em></strong></span></p> <p><img align=""right"" border=""0"" hspace=""5""   src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/harpercollins-ems/vaynerchuk-250.jpg""   vspace=""5"" /> Everything has changed. The social media revolution has irreversibly changed the   way we live our lives and conduct our business. There are billions of dollars in advertising   moving online, waiting to be claimed by whoever can build the best content and communities.   Despite this change, most people keep working at jobs that don’t make them happy and   businesses continue to ignore the major marketing and public relations benefits that can be   found online. <br /></p> <p><strong>Myth #1: </strong><em>I’m not passionate about something sexy or popular like   wine so these lessons don’t apply to me. </em><br /></p> <p>The internet has drastically decreased the costs of building communities around niche   subjects, allowing for even the most obscure subjects to draw enough eyeballs to command   advertising attention. Starting a video blog about tortilla chips may seem farfetched until   Doritos gives you a call and offers 40,000 a year to sponsor and advertise on your blog. <br   /></p> <p><strong>Myth #2:</strong> <em>My business already has a Twitter account and a Facebook page,   we’re set in the social media department. </em><br /></p> <p>This is the equivalent of claiming twenty years ago that just because your business bought a   TV spot and a few ads in the newspaper, you didn’t need to pay attention to your   advertising department. Social media isn’t about joining in, it’s about being   involved. <br /></p> <p><strong>Myth #3:</strong> <em>I’m happy at my job so this book is irrelevant to   me.</em> <br /></p> <p>First of all, congratulations on finding work that makes you happy! However, the lessons in   this book are valuable to anyone, regardless of their employment status. <em>Crush It</em> will   show you how to utilize high level and platform specific social media and marketing strategies   that will improve your work. It will also show you how to build a personal brand so that even if   you’re forced to leave your job, a situation that’s especially relevant today,   you’ll be able to easily find employment elsewhere in a field you’re passionate   about. <br /></p> <p><strong>Myth #4:</strong> <em>I need to quit my job to take advantage of this book’s   entrepreneurial lessons. </em><br /></p> <p>While the entrepreneurial strategies in this book do take time, it’s completely   reasonable to start the effort as an after-work project to build up until you’re able to   replace your current income with the income from your online presence. While you may have to   fall behind on the current season of Lost or let your Madden 2010 game suffer, because   you’ll be doing something you love you won’t mind putting in the extra effort. <br   /></p> <p>In <em>Crush It</em>, Gary Vaynerchuk shows how anyone can build a career around what   they’re passionate about. He also delivers both high-level and platform specific strategy   and analysis, allowing you to take advantage of the current business environment while preparing   you to succeed as it changes and evolves. <br /></p> <p>This book isn’t interested in making unrealistic promises while glossing over the work   involved. Making a living by building content around your passion isn’t simple and it   doesn’t happen overnight. What it is, however, is fulfilling and in most cases just as   profitable, if not more so, than your previous job. <br /></p> <p>Furthermore, a business can’t just pay lip service to social media and expect it to   return results. The transparency and accountability inherent in its structure necessitates a   comprehensive and dedicated strategy in order to reap its tremendous benefits. <br /></p> <p>By combining practical analysis and strategy with the same passion and humor that’s   made Gary one of the most in demand keynote speakers in the U.S. as well as network   television’s go to wine expert, <em>Crush It</em> is essential reading for anyone who   wants to understand and harness the future of business and work. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn: </strong>Why social media has evened the playing field, destroying the   “gate-keepers” who had previously dictated the distribution of content.</p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> How to beat unemployment and create wealth-building opportunities by   building and maintaining a personal brand. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Why storytelling is the most important business concept in the   current marketplace. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> How you can build an online business around your passion without   quitting your day job. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Why Twitter and Facebook are just tools and not a social media   strategy. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> How to take advantage of the half-billion dollars in advertising that   are moving to the internet. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Why transparency and being true to yourself are now winning marketing   formulas. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> How to build and maintain an online community around your passion and   brand. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Strategies for turning attention into money. <br /></p> <p><strong>Learn:</strong> Why the legacy element of the internet era is so underrated.</p>"

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,"{""Mark Manson""}","<p><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.</p><p>For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. </p><p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. </p><p>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>"

Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,"{""J. D. Vance""}","<p><strong><em>#1 NEW YORK TIMES </em>BESTSELLER, NAMED BY THE <em>TIMES </em>AS ONE OF ""6 BOOKS TO HELP UNDERSTAND TRUMP'S WIN""</strong></p><p><strong>""You will not read a more important book about America this year.</strong><strong>""—<em>The Economist </em></strong></p><p><strong>""A riveting book.""—<em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p><p><strong>""Essential reading.""—David Brooks,</strong><strong> </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em></p><p>From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a powerful account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America’s white working class</p><p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.</p><p>The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.</p><p>But as the family saga of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance’s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.</p><p>A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</p>"
Ego Is the Enemy,"{""Ryan Holiday""}","<p><b>The instant <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, and international bestseller<br><br>“While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” —from the prologue</b> <br> <br>Many of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back. <br> <br><i>Ego Is the Enemy </i>draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well. <br> <br>In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts. Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”</p>"
Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto),"{""Nassim Nicholas Taleb""}","<b><i>Antifragile </i>is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series are <i>Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, </i>and <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i>.</b><br><br>Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of <i>The Black Swan</i> and one of the foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.<br>  <br> Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.  <br>  <br> In <i>The Black Swan, </i>Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In <i>Antifragile,</i> Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. <br>  <br> Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call “efficient” not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.<br>  <br> <i>Antifragile</i> is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.<br>  <br> Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Antifragile</i></b><br>  <br>“Ambitious and thought-provoking . . . highly entertaining.”<b>—<i>The Economist</i></b><br>  <br> “A bold book explaining how and why we should embrace uncertainty, randomness, and error . . . It may just change our lives.”<b>—<i>Newsweek</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> “Revelatory . . . [Taleb] pulls the reader along with the logic of a Socrates.”<b>—<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br> <b> </b><br> “Startling . . . richly crammed with insights, stories, fine phrases and intriguing asides . . . I will have to read it again. And again.”<b>—Matt Ridley, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>  <br> “Trenchant and persuasive . . . Taleb’s insatiable polymathic curiosity knows no bounds. . . . You finish the book feeling braver and uplifted.”<b>—<i>New Statesman</i></b><br>  <br> “Antifragility isn’t just sound economic and political doctrine. It’s also the key to a good life.”<b>—<i>Fortune</i></b><br> <i> </i><br> “At once thought-provoking and brilliant.”<b><i>—Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2012</strong>: Fragile things break under stress. But, according to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, there's an entire class of other things that don't simply resist stress but actually grow, strengthen, or otherwise gain from unforeseen and otherwise unwelcome stimuli. Taleb sees degrees of antifragility everywhere, from fasting, mythology, and urban planning to economic, technological, cultural, and biological systems. The wealth of radical thinking in this book astounds; the glossary alone offered more thought-provoking ideas than any other nonfiction book I read this year. That said, <i>Antifragile</i> is far from flawless. As comical as Taleb's rough handling of his favorite targets can be--academics, economists, and tourists, to name a few--his argumentative style boasts gaping holes, non sequiturs aplenty, and at times an almost willfully repugnant tone. Some readers will find Taleb's brashness off-putting; others will embrace it as a charismatic component of the ideas themselves. Either way, no one will finish this book unchanged. --<i>Jason Kirk</i>"

Man's Search for Meaning,"{""Viktor E. Frankl""}","Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning"")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<br><br>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a ""book that made a difference in your life"" found <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> among the ten most influential books in America."
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)","{""Richard P. Feynman"",""Ralph Leighton""}","<p><strong>A <em>New York Times</em> bestseller―the outrageous exploits of one of this century's greatest scientific minds and a legendary American original.</strong></p><p>Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; painting a naked female toreador. In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric―a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.</p> Black-and-white photographs throughoutA series of anecdotes shouldn't by rights add up to an  autobiography, but that's just one of the many pieces of received  wisdom that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88)  cheerfully ignores in his engagingly eccentric book, a bestseller  ever since its initial publication in 1985. Fiercely independent (read  the chapter entitled ""Judging Books by Their Covers""), intolerant of  stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check  out ""Is Electricity Fire?""), unafraid to offend (see ""You Just  <I>Ask</I> Them?""), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to  enjoy <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</i> simply as a bunch of  hilarious yarns with the smart-alecky author as know-it-all hero. At  some point, however, attentive readers realize that underneath all the  merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic  knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up  on seemingly insoluble problems; and total disrespect for fancy ideas  that have no grounding in the real world. Feynman himself had all  these qualities in spades, and they come through with vigor and verve  in his no-bull prose. No wonder his students--and readers around the  world--adored him. <I>--Wendy Smith</I>"

Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life,"{""Anne Lamott""}","""Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he'd had three months to write. It was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my  brother's shoulder, and said, 'Bird by bird, buddy.  Just take it bird by bird.'""Think you've got a book inside of you? Anne Lamott isn't afraid to help you let it out. She'll help you find your passion and your voice, beginning from the first really crummy draft to the peculiar letdown of publication.

Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,"{""Cal Newport""}","<div><b>One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b></div> <br> <div>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.</div> <br> <div>In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four ""rules,"" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill. </div> <br> <div>A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. DEEP WORK is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</div>"
Dune,"{""Frank Herbert""}","Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, <b>Dune</b> is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family--and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.<br><p>A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what it undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.</p>This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the ""spice of spices."" Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides.  The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die.  There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah.  His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. <p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.  The setting is elaborate and ornate, the plot labyrinthine, the adventures exciting. Five sequels follow. <I>--Brooks Peck</I>"

In a series of now-classic books that have been translated into 36 languages and reached millions of readers around the world, he has taught generations of readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. In <i>Linchpin</i>, he turns his attention to the individual, and explains how anyone can make a significant impact within their organization.<br> <br>There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. <br> <br>Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the likes of... <br> <br>· Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. <br>· Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a résumé. <br>· David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffee shop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. <br> <br>As Godin writes, ""Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must.""<span class=""h1""> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Hugh MacLeod Reviews <em>Linchpin</em></strong> </span> <br /> <br /> <strong> Hugh MacLeod  is an artist, cartoonist, and Web 2.0 pundit whose blog, gapingvoid.com, has two million unique monthly visitors.

He’s pulling fewer punches. He’s out for blood. He’s out to make a difference. And that glorious, heartfelt passion is obvious on every page, even if it is in Seth’s usual quiet, lucid, understated manner. <br /> <br /> A linchpin, as Seth describes it, is somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced—her role is just far too unique and valuable. And then he goes on to say, well, seriously folks, you need to be one of these people, you really do. To not be one is economic and career suicide.  <br /> <br /> No surprises there—that’s exactly what one would expect Seth to say. But here’s where it gets interesting. <br /> <br /> In his best-known book,   <em>Purple Cow</em>,  Seth’s message was, “Everyone’s a marketer now.” In   <em>All Marketers Are Liars</em>,  his message was, “Everyone’s a storyteller now.” In   <em>Tribes</em>,  his message was, “Everyone’s a leader now.”  <br /> <br /> And from <em>Linchpin</em>? <br /> <br /> ""Everyone’s an artist now."" <br /> <br /> By Seth’s definition, an artist is not just some person who messes around with paint and brushes, an artist is somebody who does (and I LOVE this term) “emotional work.” <br /> <br /> Work that you put your heart and soul into. Work that matters. Work that you gladly sacrifice all other alternatives for. As a working artist and cartoonist myself, I know exactly what he means. It’s not what you do, it’s the way that you do it. <br /> <br /> The only people who have a hope of becoming linchpins in any organization, who have any hope of changing anything for the better in real terms, are those who have the capacity to do “emotional work” at a high level—to be true artists at whatever they set their minds on doing. The guys who just plod around the office corridors, just turning up for their paycheck.... Well, those guys don’t have a prayer, poor things. The world is just too interesting and competitive now. <br /> <br /> And Seth then challenges us, the readers, to become linchpins ourselves. To make the leap. To become artists. To do emotional work, whatever the sacrifice may be. It’s our choice, and it’s our burden. Seth won’t be there to catch us if we fall, but to become the people we need to be eventually, well, we probably wouldn’t want him to, anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Seth. You have penned a real gem of a book here. Rock on. <br /> <br /> <em>--Hugh MacLeod</em>"

Now customers' demands for authenticity, originality, creativity, honesty, and good intent have made it necessary for companies and brands to revert to a level of customer service rarely seen since our great-grandparents' day, when business owners often knew their customers personally, and gave them individual attention.</p> <p>Here renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk reveals how companies big and small can scale that kind of personal, one-on-one attention to their entire customer base, no matter how large, using the same social media platforms that carry consumer word of mouth. <em>The Thank You Economy</em> offers compelling, data-driven evidence that we have entered into an entirely new business era, one in which the companies that see the biggest returns won't be the ones that can throw the most money at an advertising campaign, but will be those that can prove they care about their customers more than anyone else. The businesses and brands that harness the word-of-mouth power from social media, those that can shift their culture to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly, will pull away from the pack and profit in today's markets.</p> <p>Filled with Vaynerchuk's irrepressible candor and wit, as well as real-world examples of companies that are profiting by putting Thank You Economy principles into practice, <em>The Thank You Economy</em> reveals how businesses can harness all the changes and challenges inherent in social media and turn them into tremendous opportunities for profit and growth.</p><br /> <strong class=""h1""> Amazon Exclusive: Gary Vaynerchuk on <i>The Thank You Economy</i></strong> <br />  <img height=""200"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/harper/images/TYEconomyWeb._V170794679_.gif"" style=""float: right;"" width=""300"" />  <br><i>The Thank You Economy</i> is much more than saying ""thank you.” <i>The Thank You Economy</i> represents a much bigger movement.  This book could easily have been called <i>The Humanization of Business or Manners Marketing</i>.</p>  <p>I feel that we're living through the biggest culture shift of our time. The internet, itself, is 17-years-old. It's just hitting the social part of its life. It's just like growing up. As you get to 13, 14 and 15, you want to go out and go to parties. That's what's happening right now! The internet is growing up.</p>  <p>What happens when we live in this word of mouth world where we're tweeting out ""I love Company X's orange juice""? We're sharing thoughts that we never would have picked up the phone and called somebody about in the past. What happens when brands can be humanized? In <i>The Thank You Economy</i>, I tackle the issue of the ROI of social media and provide case studies.  I think we wrote a much, much stronger book than I did with <i>Crush It</i>.  When I say we, I mean the people in the social graph--the people that are living it.</p>  <p>There is enormous ROI in social media. It's like my famous saying though, ""What's the ROI of your mother?"" The data isn't as black and white like it has been in the past. I firmly believe that the brands that have a soul and a heart and understand how to scale this will win.</p>  <p>This is a comprehensive book from a guy that has lived in the social space for the last 6 years like I have. I live and breathe my community and I've been able to consult with big brands for the past two years on how to leverage this world of caring.  This is the perfect book, not only for entrepreneurs who might have an employee or two, but also for brand managers and CMOs at bigger companies.</p>"
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values,"{""Robert M. Pirsig""}","<p>One of the most important and influential books written in the past half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son. A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.</p>In his now classic <I>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</I>, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.<p> Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. <p> In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincaré, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of <I>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</I> turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between <I>The Razor's Edge</I> and <I>Sophie's World</I>, <I>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</I> takes us into ""the high country of the mind"" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility. <I>--Brian Bruya</I>"
Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,"{""David Allen""}","<b><b>""The Bible of business and personal productivity"" —<i>Lifehack</i></b><br><br>""A completely revised and updated edition of the blockbuster bestseller from 'the personal productivity guru'""<b>—</b><i>Fast Company</i></b><br><br>Since it was first published almost fifteen years ago, David Allen’s <i>Getting Things Done </i>has become one of the most influential business books of its era, and the ultimate book on personal organization. “GTD” is now shorthand for an entire way of approaching professional and personal tasks, and has spawned an entire culture of websites, organizational tools, seminars, and offshoots.<br> <br>Allen has rewritten the book from start to finish, tweaking his classic text with important perspectives on the new workplace, and adding material that will make the book fresh and relevant for years to come. This new edition of <i>Getting Things Done </i>will be welcomed not only by its hundreds of thousands of existing fans but also by a whole new generation eager to adopt its proven principles.With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, ""flow,"" ""mind like water,"" and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called <I>Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance</I>.<p>  Not quite. Yes, <I>Getting Things Done</I> offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible <I>Fast Company</I> has dubbed ""the personal productivity guru,""  suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)<p>  As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant ""in-basket"" <p>  That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --<I>Timothy Murphy</I>"
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,"{""Susan Cain""}","<p><b>The book that started the Quiet Revolution<br></b><br>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. <br><br>In <i>Quiet, </i>Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <i>Quiet </i>has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.<br><br>Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content</p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2012</strong>:  How many introverts do you know? The real answer will probably surprise you. In our culture, which emphasizes group work from elementary school through the business world, everything seems geared toward extroverts. Luckily, introverts everywhere have a new spokesperson: Susan Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert who’s taken it upon herself to better understand the place of introverts in culture and society. With <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking</em>, Cain explores introversion through psychological research old and new, personal experiences, and even brain chemistry, in an engaging and highly-readable fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain also seeks to find ways for introverts and extroverts to better understand one another--and for introverts to understand their own contradictions, such as the ability to act like extroverts in certain situations. Highly accessible and uplifting for any introvert--and any extrovert who knows an introvert (and over one-third of us are introverts)--<em>Quiet</em> has the potential to revolutionize the “extrovert ideal.”<em> –Malissa Kent</em> <br> <br>  <hr size=""1"" /> <span class=""h1""><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Q & A with Author Susan Cain</strong></span> <br /> <br /> <img height=""289"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/merch/rh/a/SusanCain_Photo-Credit-Aaron-Fedor._V166008539_.jpg"" style=""float: right;"" width=""300"" /><strong>Q: Why did you write the book?</strong><br /> <strong> A:</strong> For the same reason that Betty Friedan published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963. Introverts are to extroverts what women were to men at that time--second-class citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts, and many introverts believe that there is something wrong with them and that they should try to “pass” as extroverts. The bias against introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy, and, ultimately, happiness. <p><strong>Q:  What personal significance does the subject have for you?</strong><br /> <strong>A:</strong> When I was in my twenties, I started practicing corporate law on Wall Street. At first I thought I was taking on an enormous challenge, because in my mind, the successful lawyer was comfortable in the spotlight, whereas I was introverted and occasionally shy. But I soon realized that my nature had a lot of advantages: I was good at building loyal alliances, one-on-one, behind the scenes; I could close my door, concentrate, and get the work done well; and like many introverts, I tended to ask a lot of questions and listen intently to the answers, which is an invaluable tool in negotiation. I started to realize that there’s a lot more going on here than the cultural stereotype of the introvert-as-unfortunate would have you believe. I had to know more, so I spent the past five years researching the powers of introversion.</p> <p><strong>Q: Was there ever a time when American society valued introverts more highly?</strong><br /> <strong>A:</strong> In the nation’s earlier years it was easier for introverts to earn respect. America once embodied what the cultural historian Warren Susman called a “Culture of Character,” which valued inner strength, integrity, and the good deeds you performed when no one was looking. You could cut an impressive figure by being quiet, reserved, and dignified. Abraham Lincoln was revered as a man who did not “offend by superiority,” as Emerson put it.</p> <p><strong>Q: You discuss how we can better embrace introverts in the workplace. Can you explain? </strong><br /> <strong>A:</strong> Introverts thrive in environments that are not overstimulating—surroundings in which they can think (deeply) before they speak. This has many implications. Here are two to consider: (1) Introverts perform best in quiet, private workspaces—but unfortunately we’re trending in precisely the opposite direction, toward open-plan offices. (2) If you want to get the best of all your employees’ brains, don’t simply throw them into a meeting and assume you’re hearing everyone’s ideas. You’re not; you’re hearing from the most vocally assertive people. Ask people to put their ideas in writing before the meeting, and make sure you give everyone time to speak.</p> <p><strong>Q: <em>Quiet</em> offers some terrific insights for the parents of introverted children. What environment do introverted kids need in order to thrive, whether it’s at home or at school? </strong><br /> <strong>A:</strong> The best thing parents and teachers can do for introverted kids is to treasure them for who they are, and encourage their passions. This means: (1) Giving them the space they need. If they need to recharge alone in their room after school instead of plunging into extracurricular activities, that’s okay. (2) Letting them master new skills at their own pace. If they’re not learning to swim in group settings, for example, teach them privately. (3) Not calling them “shy”--they’ll believe the label and experience their nervousness as a fixed trait rather than an emotion they can learn to control.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are the advantages to being an introvert?</strong><br /> <strong>A:</strong> There are too many to list in this short space, but here are two seemingly contradictory qualities that benefit introverts: introverts like to be alone--and introverts enjoy being cooperative. Studies suggest that many of the most creative people are introverts, and this is partly because of their capacity for quiet. Introverts are careful, reflective thinkers who can tolerate the solitude that idea-generation requires. On the other hand, <em>implementing</em> good ideas requires cooperation, and introverts are more likely to prefer cooperative environments, while extroverts favor competitive ones.</p> <p></p>  <div class=""aplus""> <h4>A Reader’s Guide for <i>Quiet:The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking</i></h4> <p>By Susan Cain</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts.

On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft,"{""Stephen King""}","Immensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King’s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.<BR><BR>“Long live the King” hailed <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> upon publication of Stephen King’s <i>On Writing</i>. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer’s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King’s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999—and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, <i>On Writing</i> will empower and entertain everyone who reads it—fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.Short and snappy as it is, Stephen King's <I>On Writing</I> really contains two books: a fondly sardonic autobiography and a tough-love lesson for aspiring novelists. The memoir is terrific stuff, a vivid description of how a writer grew out of a misbehaving kid. You're right there with the young author as he's tormented by poison ivy, gas-passing babysitters, uptight schoolmarms, and a laundry job nastier than Jack London's. It's a ripping yarn that casts a sharp light on his fiction. This was a child who dug Yvette Vickers from <I>Attack of the Giant Leeches</I>, not Sandra Dee.  ""I wanted monsters that ate whole cities, radioactive corpses that came out of the ocean and ate surfers, and girls in black bras who looked like trailer trash."" But massive reading on all literary levels was a craving just as crucial, and soon King was the published author of ""I Was a Teen-Age Graverobber."" As a young adult raising a family in a trailer, King started a story inspired by his stint as a janitor cleaning a high-school girls locker room. He crumpled it up, but his writer wife retrieved it from the trash, and using her advice about the girl milieu and his own memories of two reviled teenage classmates who died young, he came up with <I>Carrie</I>. King gives us lots of revelations about his life and work. The kidnapper character in <I>Misery</I>, the mind-possessing monsters in <I>The Tommyknockers</I>, and the haunting of the blocked writer in <I>The Shining</I> symbolized his cocaine and booze addiction (overcome thanks to his wife's intervention, which he describes). ""There's one novel, <I>Cujo</I>, that I barely remember writing."" <p>  King also evokes his college days and his recovery from the van crash that nearly killed him, but the focus is always on what it all means to the craft. He gives you a whole writer's ""tool kit"": a reading list, writing assignments, a corrected story, and nuts-and-bolts advice on dollars and cents, plot and character, the basic building block of the paragraph, and literary models.

Between the World and Me,"{""Ta-Nehisi Coates""}","<b><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER | NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER | NAACP IMAGE AWARD WINNER | PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST | <b>NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FINALIST | NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>The New York Times Book Review • O: The Oprah Magazine • The Washington Post • People • <b><i>Entertainment Weekly • </i></b>Vogue • Los Angeles Times • San Francisco Chronicle • Chicago Tribune • New York • Newsday • Library Journal • Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><i><br></i>Hailed by Toni Morrison as “required reading,” a bold and personal literary exploration of America’s racial history by “the single best writer on the subject of race in the United States” (<i>The New York Observer</i>)</b></b><br><br> <i>“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”</i><br><br>In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br><br> <i>Between the World and Me </i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, <i>Between the World and Me </i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Between the World and Me</i></b><br><br>“I’ve been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of <i>Between the World and Me, </i>like Coates’s journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory.”<b>—Toni Morrison</b><br><br> “Powerful and passionate . . . profoundly moving . . . a searing meditation on what it means to be black in America today.”<b>—Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br> “Really powerful and emotional.”<b>—John Legend, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> “Extraordinary.”<b>—David Remnick, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br> “Brilliant . . . a mature writer entirely consumed by a momentous subject and working at the extreme of his considerable powers.”<b>—<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br> “An eloquent blend of history, reportage, and memoir.”<b>—<i>The Boston Globe</i></b><br><br> “[Coates] speaks resolutely and vividly to all of black America.”<b>—<i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br> “A work that’s both titanic and timely . . . the latest essential reading in America’s social canon.”<b>—<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2015:</strong> Readers of his work in <em>The Atlantic</em> and elsewhere know Ta-Nehisi Coates for his thoughtful and influential writing on race in America. Written as a series of letters to his teenaged son, his new memoir, <em>Between the World and Me</em>, walks us through the course of his life, from the tough neighborhoods of Baltimore in his youth, to Howard University—which Coates dubs “The Mecca” for its revelatory community of black students and teachers—to the broader Meccas of New York and Paris. Coates describes his observations and the evolution of his thinking on race, from Malcolm X to his conclusion that race itself is a fabrication, elemental to the concept of American (white) exceptionalism. Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, and South Carolina are not bumps on the road of progress and harmony, but the results of a systemized, ubiquitous threat to “black bodies” in the form of slavery, police brutality, and mass incarceration. Coates is direct and, as usual, uncommonly insightful and original. There are no wasted words. This is a powerful and exceptional book.<em>--Jon Foro</em></p>"
"Losing My Virginity: How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way","{""Richard Branson""}","<b>""Oh, screw it, let's do it.""</b><br><br>That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br><br>Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then, Branson has written his own ""rules"" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br><br>Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br>And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br><br> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br><br>Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br><br>Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br><br>Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br><br>Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br><br>Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br><br>And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.<br><br><b>Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing,</b><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

"Wherever You Go, There You Are","{""Jon Kabat-Zinn""}","When <em>Wherever You Go, There You Are</em> was first published in 1994, no one could have predicted that the book would launch itself onto bestseller lists nationwide and sell over 750,000 copies to date. Ten years later, the book continues to change lives. In honor of the book's 10th anniversary, Hyperion is proud to be releasing the book with a new afterword by the author, and to share this wonderful book with an even larger audience.In his follow-up to <I>Full Catastrophe Living</I>--a book in which he presented basic meditation techniques as a way of reducing stress and healing from illness--here Jon Kabat-Zinn goes much more deeply into the practice of meditation for its own sake. To Kabat-Zinn, meditation is important because it brings about a state of ""mindfulness,"" a condition of ""being"" rather than ""doing"" during which you pay attention to the moment rather than the past, the future, or the multitudinous distractions of modern life. In brief, rather poetic chapters, he describes different meditative practices and what they can do for the practitioner. The idea that meditation is ""spiritual"" is often confusing to people, Kabat-Zinn writes; he prefers to think of it as what you might call a workout for your consciousness. This book makes learning meditation remarkably easy (although <I>practicing</I> it is not). But it also makes it seem infinitely appealing. <I>--Ben Kallen</I>"

"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead","{""Sheryl Sandberg""}","<p>Thirty years after women became 50 percent of the college graduates in the United States, men still hold the vast majority of leadership positions in government and industry. This means that women’s voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In <i>Lean In,</i> Sheryl Sandberg examines why women’s progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers compelling, commonsense solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential. <br><br>Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on <i>Fortune</i>’s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of <i>Time</i>’s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to “sit at the table,” seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto.<br><br>In <i>Lean In,</i> Sandberg digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of “having it all.”  She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. <br><br>Written with both humor and wisdom<i>,</i> Sandberg’s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth. <i>Lean In</i> is destined to change the conversation from what women can’t do to what they can.</p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2013</strong>: Anyone who's watched Sheryl Sandberg's popular TED Talk, ""Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders,"" is familiar with--and possibly haunted by--the idea of ""having it all."" ""Perhaps the greatest trap ever set for women was the coining of this phrase,"" writes Sandberg in <i>Lean In</i>, which expands on her talk's big idea: that increasing the number of women at the top of their fields will benefit everyone. Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, encourages women to challenge the common workplace assumption that ""men still run the world."" She asks men to be real partners, sharing in the family work that typically leads to a woman's decision to stay home; she asks women who expect to start a family soon not to check out of work mentally. Sandberg's critics note that her advice may not resonate with the masses: The Harvard-educated exec can afford a veritable army to help raise her children. But Sandberg's point--which affects all of us--is that women who have what it takes to succeed at the highest professional level face many obstacles, both internal and external. <i>Lean In</i> is likely to spur the conversations that must happen for institutional changes to take place at work. --<i>Alexandra Foster</i>"
